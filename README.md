![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)

## Project Description

In today's competitive job market, understanding employer expectations is vital for job seekers aiming to align their skills with industry demands. This project analyzes job postings from LinkedIn to extract actionable insights into required skills, job description trends, and corporate recruitment strategies. Leveraging data analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it identifies in-demand skills, uncovers hidden requirements within job descriptions, and decodes company hiring patterns. These findings empower job seekers to tailor their applications and skill development effectively, while demonstrating proficiency in data science methodologies applicable across various domains.

## Objectives

- **Identify In-Demand Skills**: Determine the most frequently required skills across LinkedIn job postings.
- **Analyze Job Descriptions**: Extract hidden requirements and thematic trends from job descriptions.
- **Cluster Corporate Strategies**: Group companies by skill requirements to reveal recruitment patterns.
- **Visualize Insights**: Provide interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration.

## Data Source and Preprocessing

The dataset comprises job postings sourced from LinkedIn, including fields such as job titles, descriptions, and skills. Due to privacy and LinkedIn's terms of service, the raw data is not included in this repository. Instead, a sample dataset with a comparable structure is provided (`sample_linkedin_data.csv`) for demonstration. Preprocessing steps, implemented in `01_Data-Preprocess.ipynb`, include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing rows with missing or empty skill entries.
- **Skill Normalization**: Standardizing skill formats by replacing "和" with "、" and combining skill columns into a unified list.

## Methodology

The analysis is structured across multiple Jupyter notebooks, each addressing a distinct analytical component:

1. **`02_WordCloud.ipynb`**  
   - **Technique**: Generates word clouds and frequency charts using the `WordCloud` library.
   - **Purpose**: Visualizes the most common skills and keywords in job postings.

2. **`03_Core-Skills-Requirements-Analysis.ipynb`**  
   - **Techniques**: 
     - Frequency analysis to identify prevalent skills.
     - Association rule mining with `mlxtend` to detect skill co-occurrences.
     - K-means clustering (`scikit-learn`) on TF-IDF vectors to group companies by skill preferences.
   - **Purpose**: Uncovers skill combinations and company-specific skill trends.

3. **`04_Job-Content-Deep-Dive.ipynb`**  
   - **Techniques**: 
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER) with `spaCy` to extract technical entities (e.g., tools, languages).
     - Topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using `Gensim` to identify description themes.
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes job description content for hidden requirements and thematic patterns.

4. **`05_Corporate-Recruitment-Strategy-Decoding.ipynb`**  
   - **Techniques**: 
     - TF-IDF transformation (`scikit-learn`) for skill vectorization.
     - Cosine similarity to measure company skill profile similarity.
     - LDA topic modeling for company skill topics.
     - Interactive dashboard creation with `Plotly`.
   - **Purpose**: Clusters companies by skill requirements and visualizes recruitment strategies.

## Results

Key findings include:

- **Top Skills**: Python, SQL, and Analytical Skills emerged as the most frequently demanded competencies.
- **Skill Combinations**: Strong associations were found, e.g., "Troubleshooting" frequently co-occurs with "Networking" (confidence: 1.0).
- **Job Description Themes**: Topics such as "Data Analysis" and "Technical Support" dominate postings.
- **Company Clusters**: Five distinct clusters identified, reflecting varied recruitment focuses (e.g., technical vs. analytical roles).

Visualizations enhance interpretability:
- Word clouds and bar charts (`02_WordCloud.ipynb`).
- Association rule networks and cluster plots (`03_Core-Skills-Requirements-Analysis.ipynb`).
- LDA topic visualizations (`04_Job-Content-Deep-Dive.ipynb`).
- An interactive dashboard (`tech_stack_dashboard.html` from `05_Corporate-Recruitment-Strategy-Decoding.ipynb`).

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-market-insights.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Notebooks**:
   - Execute notebooks sequentially from `01_Data-Preprocess.ipynb` to `05_Corporate-Recruitment-Strategy-Decoding.ipynb`.
   - Use the provided sample data or replace with your own dataset in the same format.
4. **View Dashboard**:
   - Open `tech_stack_dashboard.html` in a web browser for interactive exploration.
