We are looking for an IT Support Specialist




At Chaos Theory, we're at the cutting edge of digital innovation, where creative tech meets powerful simplicity. Our team operates with a Mac-based and SaaS-driven tech stack, empowering us to scale efficiently without legacy server management. We're looking for an IT professional who thrives in a modern, cloud-first environment to support our growing team with skill, speed, and finesse.


A Day in the Life




Your day starts with reviewing the help desk requests: HR needs accounts and hardware set up for a new user, so you dive into Google Workspace, Slack and Notion then customize their Macbook for our settings. There are also a couple of troubleshooting requests which you resolve, and a security alert to follow up on. You then do a walk around in the office checking all the meeting rooms are all set in terms of their setup for Google meet calls, cable management etc. and fix a couple of small problems you spot. A team mate grabs you while you're walking past and asks for some advice on automating some functions in Google Sheets, you give some initial advice then add it to your list to discuss this in more depth with them soon - you love finding ways to help people do their work more efficiently! Next up is your monthly review of SaaS licenses across the company - you're making sure they're fit for purpose, appropriately distributed to team members who need them and costs are managed.


After lunch, you're responding to a few alerts and some new help desk tickets, including reviewing and approving Slack app additions for security and suitability, keeping us organized and protected. You carve out some time in the afternoon to start the planning phase for a longer-term project, we're getting more globally distributed as we continue to hire folks remotely and you want to streamline the asset distribution and tracking for remote workstations. You end the day making progress on an ongoing piece of work: auditing and updating all Google groups and accounts, you're enjoying clearing out the ones you've confirmed are unneeded and ensuring the team only sees what they need, and it's easy to manage.


Every day is a balance between essential troubleshooting, continuous improvements, and proactively helping the whole team work more effectively. You make the most of it. You're in control. We all win.

To succeed in this role, you'll need:



Experience with MacOS and SaaS management (e.g. Google Workspace, Slack, Notion, VPNs).
Solid understanding of cybersecurity best practices - you'll be at the front line of setting up core systems and approving/suggesting changes to keep the company secure.
Effective verbal and written English communication skills - you'll be supporting both technical and non-technical team members, creating clear plans for changes, and dealing with senior stakeholders.
Attention to detail - you know the critical nature of being a system admin and pay close attention to the accuracy of your work.
Organizational skills - you're a one-person IT team so your ability to create scalable processes, juggle priorities and keep track of requests will keep things running smoothly.
Problem-solving agility - you're adept at finding creative, secure solutions on the fly.
It'd be great — but not necessary — if you also had:



Knowledge of Jira Cloud admin setup and management - it's becoming a core tool for us so someone who has been hands on as an admin before will be at an advantage.
Experience providing IT support in a remote or distributed team environment - we work all over the globe!
Hands on experience with Office 365/Windows computers - some small parts of our business use these.
Automation and optimization skills - spotting and implementing automations, to save time and reduce repetitive tasks for yourself and the whole team. (e.g. Jira, Google Sheets, etc.)
You will be responsible for:



User and License Management: Manage accounts across our SaaS ecosystem.
Onboarding and Offboarding: Provide IT onboarding for new hires, and coordinate secure offboarding for departing employees.
Workstation Management: Manage security requirements e.g. FileVault, setting firewall configurations, and password policies.
Password Management: Own our corporate password management solution end to end, from admin side to user management.
Hardware/Asset Management: Oversee asset tracking and hardware support for remote and onsite employees, handle new purchases and device setup, and manage device repairs and replacements.
WiFi and Network Support: Monitor and maintain the office WiFi network in Hong Kong, and manage updates or expansions as needed, provide advice/consulting to other offices.
Key software administration: You'll be org admin of selected key business software, ensuring maintenance, alignment and cross-company consistency, requirements gathering, training, change management, and documentation.
Security Monitoring: Create, maintain and act upon security alerts, following up as necessary to ensure a secure environment. 
Cost Management: Track license usage to ensure cost-efficiency and optimization of subscriptions.
In exchange we offer:



A dynamic, collaborative, fun, yet challenging work environment.
Attractive salary and benefits.
Flexible working hours.
An office located in the heart of Central, Hong Kong
A state-of-the-art entertaining floor, including a fully stocked bar and pantry, gaming consoles, and a growing library.
A team of 100+ globally representing over 20 countries — we're multi-cultural and proud of it!
Onsite company gym / yoga studio with showers, changing rooms and free daily classes.
Expensed weekly team lunches and regular social events.
Company events, including Christmas and Summer parties and our much loved beach BBQs.


Where you'll work:




Based out of six floors of office, gym, yoga studio, and entertainment space in Hong Kong's SoHo district, we work with colleagues around the world to shake things up in one of the most exciting places on the internet today — the digital center of sports, entertainment, and cryptocurrency.


We'd love to have you in Hong Kong - it's a local gig!

About the Position




Machine learning is a critical pillar of Jane Street's global business, and our ever-changing trading environment serves as a unique, rapid-feedback platform for ML experimentation. 




Researchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software engineering roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.




We’re looking for people to join the research team with deep ML experience in either an applied or academic context. A good candidate should have a deep understanding of a wide variety of ML techniques, and a passion for tinkering with model architectures, feature transformations, and hyperparameters to generate robust inferences.

Who We Are

Let Our Journeys Enrich Life

Carry essentials exist to make movement a worry-free experience, allowing us to focus on the bigger picture of our journeys. Today's industry brands are exhibiting a growing disconnection from the deeper purpose of movement, seen in standard-fare products that neither challenge norms nor present new solutions that facilitate better mobility.

LOJEL is about refocusing on how people move, but more importantly, why: connection. Putting the purpose of our journeys at the forefront of the discussion opens up opportunities for innovation. This process of discovery is what lets us empower people to move better and focus on what truly matters.

Our mission is to spark the human connections that make the world a better place—by empowering people’s journeys with thoughtful carry essentials for travel and everyday movement. We are Driven By Diversity, Intentional By Design and Purposely Positive—core values upholding our ultimate goal to inspire movement within communities and across the globe.

LOJEL is an international carry essentials brand—founded in Japan in 1989, currently headquartered in Hong Kong with teams in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific—and is sold in 15 territories across the globe.

SUSTAINABILITY AT LOJEL

At LOJEL, we're committed to driving positive change. We recognize the challenges our world faces, particularly with the looming climate crisis. The future is uncertain, and as a forward-thinking brand, we're dedicated to taking action.

Sustainability is at the core of our mission. By 2026, we aim to achieve B Corp certification, becoming climate neutral, and ensuring that 50% of our products are crafted from recycled or sustainable materials. To achieve these goals, we're building a team that's ready to take on this challenge head-on. Join us in making a meaningful impact on our planet while embracing a rewarding career at LOJEL.

Who We Are

Let Our Journeys Enrich Life

Carry essentials exist to make movement a worry-free experience, allowing us to focus on the bigger picture of our journeys. Today's industry brands are exhibiting a growing disconnection from the deeper purpose of movement, seen in standard-fare products that neither challenge norms nor present new solutions that facilitate better mobility.

This process of discovery is what lets us empower people to move better and focus on what truly matters.

Our mission is to spark the human connections that make the world a better place—by empowering people’s journeys with thoughtful carry essentials for travel and everyday movement. We are Driven By Diversity, Intentional By Design and Purposely Positive—core values upholding our ultimate goal to inspire movement within communities and across the globe.

LOJEL is an international carry essentials brand—founded in Japan in 1989, currently headquartered in Hong Kong with teams in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific—and is sold in 15 territories across the globe.
